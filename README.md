# EzComplexSolver
This is a simple webpage which I started for personal use, 
it isn't intended to be amazing but I'll implement more 
features when I have time, as this is just a personal 
project for learning purposes.

Esta es una página simple que inicié para uso personal, 
no se espera que sea muy avanzada pero implementaré más 
funcionalidad cuando tenga tiempo, pues es un proyecto 
personal con propósitos de aprendizaje.

## How it works
The functionality is pretty straightforward atm, build 
you matrix with real or complex numbers and hit the green 
button to get a terribly un formatted answer, **doesn't 
support** advanced syntax.

Valid input format:
- -3.44 + 6.584i
- 6 - 5.48484j

## Dependencies
Currently using [math.js](https://mathjs.org/) for the 
numerical methods, it's the only dependency really, 
everything else is plain JS, HTML and CSS terribly 
wrote as I did this in a few hours over three days with 
no prior experience in frontend.
